Beta release niftijlib-0.2 March 20, 2006.
------------------------------------------------------

Changes from Beta release niftijlib-0.1 March 11, 2005:

-- Bug fix to readHeader() for reading wrong-endian datasets, thanks
   to Jason Dai for pointing this out.
-- New copyHeader() function added.
-- Small update to readNiiExt() called from readHeader() to check if a
   malformed extension appears to overrun image data.


------------------------------------------------------


niftijlib is a simple Java class to read and write datasets
in the nifti-1 file format.

niftijlib is released into the public domain.

Nift1Dataset.java. is the main i/o class.
EndianCorrectInputStream.java and EndianCorrectOutputStream.java
are support classes to deal with writing little-endian.
TestNifti1Api.java is a sample driver program that shows how to use
the methods in Nift1Dataset.



Prerequisites:
--------------------------
niftijlib was written under java 1.4.



To build:
--------------------------
Note that the jar file niftijlib.jar is included in the distribution,
so, you do not need to build, you can run the sample program directly.

Edit the Makefile to set the correct paths for your Java utilities,
e.g. javac.

make jar

niftijlib.jar will be created.

make help
for other build options



To run the sample program:
--------------------------
Make sure niftijlib.jar is in your CLASSPATH, e.g.
setenv CLASSPATH niftijlib.jar

java TestNifti1Api

This will display the help message for TestNifti1Api:

Usage: TestNifti1Api <command> <dataset> [params]


	print <dataset>
		print dataset header fields
	peek <dataset> X Y Z T
		print value at voxel location X Y Z T (0-based index)
	timecourse <dataset> X Y Z
		print timecourse at voxel location X Y Z (0-based index)
	copy <dataset> <dataset2>
		disk copy of dataset to dataset2 
	create <new dataset> <datatype> X Y Z T <A|B|X>
		create a new dataset of dimension XYZT.
		Voxel values are determined by last param.
		A -- volumes are constant val, equal to their T index.
		B -- each volume has voxels set from 0 to n, where n=(X*Y*Z)-1
		X -- voxels are 0
	extend <dataset> <extension_file> <code>
		take <extension_file> and stuff it into the header of <dataset>
		as an extension of type <code>
		<code> is an identifying code for the extension type (ask Bob).



To use Nifti1Dataset methods:
------------------------------
You can run
make docs
netscape doc/index.html &
to generate the API documentation, or, look at the documentation
on the niftilib SourceForge website:
http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/

You can also use the TestNifti1Api.java program as a sample to
get started.
