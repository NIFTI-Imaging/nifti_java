Updates to the niftijlib code

5/06    KF updated handling of gzipped datasets a little bit.  Can deal
        with gzipped headers, but still cannot write gzipped data because
        I can't find a Java gzip writer that deals with random access files

4/5/06	KF fixed bug in writeVol() in which writes of INT8 UINT8 were
	writing shorts not bytes.

4/5/06	KF changed setHeaderFilename() and setDataFilename() to try
	to avoid names with double extensions like abc.img.hdr.

4/5/06	KF added ramp along Y axis as option in TestNifti1Api "create"
	option.

3/2006 KF added a little code to readNiiExt() to check if extensions 
	overrun image data.

2/20/2006 KF  Bug fix in readHeader() for endian setting, thanks to Jason Dai.
